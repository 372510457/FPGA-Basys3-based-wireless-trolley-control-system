# FPGA-Basys3-based-wireless-trolley-control-system
	This project develops a microprocessor-based system on an FPGA and runs software on the microprocessor to write a demo application to remotely control a racing car. 
	The final system will allow the user to control the car remotely using a mouse, VGA screen and BASYS 3 FPGA board.
